# Sound Tools Backend
The main part of the application where the real processing happens.

Sound Tools is an audio tool created in hopes to make audio processing easier
(especially vocal removing where human voice is the only output from an input audio).

This makes use of an AI tool developed by *tsurumeso* (see dependencies).
